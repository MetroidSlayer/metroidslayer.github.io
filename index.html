            <p>My name is Matthew Roundy. I am a programmer and occasional artist. This is a portfolio of several projects I've worked on, both academic and personal.</p>
            <!-- stuff I value? personal life? -->
            <p>I got my start putting together games in Scratch back in middle school. Since then, I've spent years cultivating my skills in the field Computer Science. Languages I know include C, C++, C#, Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, and more.</p>
            <p>Due to my focus in game development and pixel / sprite artwork, I have an eye for design. I always prioritize the user's experience, making sure functionality and aesthetics work hand-in-hand to ensure that any user will be able to intuitively understand and make use of my software.</p>

                    <div class="col-8 pe-4">
                        <p>As a hobby, I took up game development. This led me to refining my CS skills, and taught me valuable lessons on what it means to create, maintain, and publish code to the Internet. The game is based on "Balloon in a Wasteland", an old game made in Flash, a tool mostly used to make web games in the early 2010's. I adored this game and its basic ideas, but was always frustrated by its shallow mechanics and short runtime. I took it upon myself to do the idea justice, and created this game: "mARS"</p>
                        <p>The concept of "mARS" is simple. You play as an astronaut that must escape after crashing on the surface of Mars. You fight off aliens, upgrade your equipment and shelter, and repair your ship.</p>
                        <p>The game's design, however, is pretty complex. Repairs and equipment pull from the same pool of materials, which are obtained by defeating enemies; it's up to the player to decide whether to spend their resources on escape, or to sure up their defenses so that they can survive another day. More importantly, the player must also track time. Every event is tracked and determined by a constantly-progressing day-night cycle, and repairs take a while. Will they spend their valuable time trading with shopkeepers, resting up to avoid exhaustion? Buckling down and fixing the ship instead might seem valuable, but what happens when enemies attack your ship and your hard work is reversed?</p>
                        <p>"mARS" was made in Godot 3, an open-source engine that's constantly updated and maintained. Working with open-source tools is sometimes difficult; it holds your hand less than something like Unity. In my opinion, though, that allows for much more creative freedom, and leads to much more resourceful problem-solving. Something critical I learned from making this game was the importance of bug-testing and providing updates to users. The (CONTINUE THIS)</p>

                        <p>The game can be downloaded, or the game's page viewed in more detail, using the embed on the right. I created this game before I learned how to use GitHub, so I <strong>don't have a repository for it</strong>, but I <strong>can provide source code</strong> upon request.</p>

                        <p>As I learned game development, I also took up pixel art out of necessity. I ended up finding it just as enjoyable as creating the code for my games, sometimes even more. I eventually took it up as a separate hobby, but discovered over time that it was very tedious.</p>
                        <p>On large sprite sheets, a lot of sprites will share certain aspects, often using nearly-identical artwork except for minor changes. When one is changed, every single similar sprite also needs to be updated. This doesn't sound too bad, but when there are 700 sprites on a sheet, each separated into 10 different layers, consistency becomes almost impossible. Poring over these thousands of tiny images, making sure any duplicates are up-to-date, takes hours; occasionally, I'd spend a vast majority of my time scrutinizing and copy-pasting my work, rather than actually drawing new sprites.</p>
                        <p>Frustrated, I designed Consistxels, a program written in Python that makes consistency easy (or at least easier)! First, the user inputs their sprite sheet, identifying separate layers and selecting various options. The program then runs through every single layer, detecting whether certain bits of artwork are identical. After this, the user can easily carry minor changes in one sprite over to similar sprites. I've even implemented ways to interface with existing popular art programs such as PhotoShop and Aseprite, streamlining things even further. If possible, I want to eliminate any and all disruptions in the process, leaving only the creative outlet remaining.</p>
                        <p>This is a project I'm very excited about! I believe it could help sprite artists become far more efficient. I plan on working on it extensively over the next year or so. I haven't been able to do so recently, due to my schedule becoming overloaded during my final semester at WSU, but I have plenty of ideas for what to do next.</p>

                        <p>Over the course of my education, I've had the opportunity to work with students and faculty on major projects. I took the role of a developer, tester, and client liaison. I frequently worked alongside teammates, taking leadership roles and directing our efforts as we progressed.</p>
                        <p>One major project I worked on was training software for Weber State University's theater department, meant to teach new stage managers how to properly give commands from the (booth? what's it called?). In order to accomplish this, my teammates and I met with professors from both the Computer Science and theater programs in order to ensure that the final product would suit their needs. I don't believe this program is still in use, assuming it ever was, as (EXPLAIN BETTER)</p>
                        <p>Another major project was my capstone course's final project. Alongside 9 other students, we worked with a client from the Desert Eagle RV Park, located in Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, to create a website that would allow customers to reserve sites in the park. To do so, we inherited code from another team that hadn't managed to finish the site to the client's satisfaction. We worked together, cleaned it up, and added features, keeping in communication with the client and professor as we went. (As of writing this, we're not quite done! However, once we are, I'll update this section to include notes about the client's satisfaction with the final result.)</p>
